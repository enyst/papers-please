# Papers Please

This repository is our tracker for AI research papers. We rely on `bd` (Beads) for organizing work, so please use `bd` commands to view, add, or update issues.

## Naming issues
- Use the `paper-` prefix for every individual paper we track.
- Use the `task-` prefix for any task related to the papers (summaries, replications, follow-ups, etc.).
